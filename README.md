# Deep-Learning-Application-in-Fluid-Mechanics

Machine learning and Deep learning has many applications in very diverse fields. 
Its nature of flexibility to learn various problems and predict further with good accuracy makes it widely exploited in many fields. 
As computers are strict logic machines things should be explicitly coded to automate computer processing but with the introduction of
machine learning computer’s are now able to learn and understand the behaviour and patterns inside the data and give results without being explicitly coded.
 
This project is focussed to exploit this nature of Deep Learning in classical aerospace fields
like fluid mechanics. This project incorporates the applications of Deep learning models for flow field generation and predicting
the pressure in flow field. Deep learning is used in this project for finding patterns inside the data by learning the essence of data using 
a fully- connected Neural Network architecture with suitable hyper-parameters on Keras and Tensorflow (Google’s Neural Network libraries). 
At last this project further highlights the future work that can be done using Deep Learning techniques in the field of fluid mechanics.
